                The idea for Synap started with James Gupta and Omair Vaiyani – both medical students at the University
                of Leeds, England – when they were looking for a more effective way to study for their own exams. The
                pair learnt how to code, and built a basic website and app called MyCQs which allowed students to
                create, practice and share their own Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) tests online, and practice them on
                their smartphones.
            </p>

            <p>
                The original intention was to create something that would help them and other people in their university
                as a fun project one summer, but MyCQs amassed over 13,000 downloads in under six hours, from a whole
                range of people across the world. Use of the app has been strong ever since, with users creating over
                200,000 multiple choice questions between them for practically every topic under the sun. James and
                Omair continued to add features to the site, learning more about the processes involved in learning and
                incorporating them into MyCQs over time.

            <p>
                Synap is both a natural evolution, and a significant improvement of our work on MyCQs. It is a platform
                we’re working on that will completely change the way students and professionals study. With a successful
                crowdfunded investment raise of £200,000+, we have huge plans for Synap in Q1 2016.
